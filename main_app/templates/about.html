<h4>This app is based on the Latin phrase "Ponte Las Pilas", translating to "Put on your batteries". This means "Get it together". For those of us who struggle to make time to plan our meals. This app allows you to organize your meals for the week, by giving you the ability to go into a day of the week and a meal plan for the day.</h4>
