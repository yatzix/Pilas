    This app is based on the Latin phrase "Ponte Las Pilas", translating to "Put
    on your batteries". This means "Get it together". For those of us who
    struggle to make time to plan our meals. This app allows you to organize
    your meals for the week, by giving you the ability to go into a day of the
    week and a meal plan for the day.
